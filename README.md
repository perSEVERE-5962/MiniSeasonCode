# MiniSeasonCode 23-24

## 2023 FRC Team 5962  Mini Build Season Challenge


### Goals / Why
The FRC Build season is very challenging and time is very limited.  In past seasons, the mentors were concerned that they perceived a lack of urgency and coordination with the team members.
A mini-build season is to help the team learn how to communicate well and to practice making good use of the very limited time available.  Establish a plan, and keep making progress on a schedule.
